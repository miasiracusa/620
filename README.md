# Network Analytics 
  
Assignments and projects are designed to conceptualize network data through graphing and natural language processing techniques. 

## Assignments 

1.  Basic Concepts (Nodes and Edges)  
2.  Network Building & Graph Visualization  
3.  Centrality Measures   
4.  2-Mode Network  
5.  High Frequency Words  
6.  Text Classification

## Projects

#### Project 1 - Network Analysis:  
Task: Identify and load a network dataset that has some categorical information available for each node. For each of the nodes in the dataset, calculate degree centrality and eigenvector centrality. Compare your centrality measures across your categorical groups.

#### Project 2 - Two-Mode Networks:
Task: Identify a large 2-mode network dataset—you can start with a dataset in a repository. Your data should meet the criteria that it consists of ties between and not within two (or more) distinct groups.
Reduce the size of the network using a method such as the island method described in chapter 4 of social network analysis. What can you infer about each of the distinct groups?

#### Project 3 - Text Mining:
Task: Using any of the three classifiers described in chapter 6 of Natural Language Processing with Python, and any features you can think of, build the best name gender classifier you can. Once you are satisfied with your classifier, check its final performance on the test set. How does the performance on the test set compare to the performance on the dev-test set? Is this what you'd expect?
 
#### Final Project:
Task: This project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters.
