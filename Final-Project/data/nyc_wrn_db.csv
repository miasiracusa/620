More than half of the employees in the industrial sector have a high school diploma or less and nearly a fifth have limited English proficiency. New York City is a strategic location to operate an industrial business. The unparalleled concentration of residents, businesses, economic activity, and wealth creates a tremendous end market for the industrial sector. Every employer praises the New York City workforce for its unparalleled diversity, depth of talent, commitment, and proactive attitude. Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the sector. Space to expand or relocate is expensive and scarce, operating costs are high, and there is a perception that the overall business environment presents obstacles. Our Office has begun to address these issues. Our Office broadened the Commercial Expansion Program to create benefits especially for industrial and manufacturing businesses that rent their spaces. In early 2006 our Office created 16 Industrial Business Zones across the City where expanded business services are available for industrial and manufacturing businesses. A relocation tax credit of $1,000 per employee is offered for manufacturing and industrial businesses that choose to relocate within the Industrial Business Zones.ï¿½ Moreover, the zones represent areas where the Bloomberg Administration guarantees it will prohibit any new residential development. And State tax credits are also available to qualified businesses located in certain Industrial Business Zones as a result of the recent reconfiguration of the New York City's Empire Zones. Our Office intends to see these initiatives grow and better serve the cityï¿½s industrial and manufacturing businesses. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more.

The objectives of this State-wide initiative was: 1) through the operation of a crisis intervention center, to stabilize volatile situations for families and individuals in crisis situations or to address situations that if left unaddressed could become crisis, and 2) to improve long-term economic and social conditions through the development and implementation of a Strategic Neighborhood Action Plan (SNAP).  

Since 1993, over 2,000 individuals and families have been placed in decent, affordable apartments, over 4,000 families have averted homelessness, over 2,000 families have avoided serious injury or death, have been placed in safe houses, and have secured monetary compensation and over 1,000 individuals have received HIV/AIDS services.

Although the EHNBAC downscaled its operation after NYS Neighborhood Based Alliance Initiative sunset in 1996 it continues to serve approximately 600 individuals and families per year.  Most staff are bilingual in Spanish and English.  

The EHNBAC provides crime victims with legal advocacy, family court advocacy around divorce, child visitation, child support, orders of protection.  We accompany participants to precincts, court, and the District Attorney?s Office.  

Emergency Assistance for Victims
We provide emergency services such as the changing of locks, purchase of furniture, clothing, pampers, food and payment of legal and documentation fees to regain lost or missing identification and legal documents, relocation assistance, and rent assistance if the victim is at risk of eviction.  

We provide advocacy to obtain repairs, initiation of overcharge claims, tenant landlord mediation, money management training, legal advocacy, and assistance in securing and maintaining entitlements and benefits.  

In July 2005, in response to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in East Harlem, the EHNBAC instituted its HIV/AIDS education program known as Awareness Can Change Every Persons Tomorrow (ACCEPT).  Since then, over 900 individuals have received education and services focusing on the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  The EHNBAC ACCEPT program provides case management, crisis intervention services, prevention workshops, individual and family counseling sessions, referrals to treatment at local hospitals and medical centers in the community, information and referral,  permanency planning and condom distribution. 
 
Its Homelessness Prevention Program aims to prevent eviction through Housing Court representation, tenant/landlord mediation and emergency cash assistance paid directly to landlords or utility providers.

Innovative and collaborative, the BOC Network works to close the credit and technical-assistance gap limiting the growth potential and job-creation capacities of microentrepreneurs and small businesses of hard-working men and women who operate in isolation from the mainstream market and whose businesses are an important source of jobs in their largely minority and immigrant communities. By stimulating the growth of profitable enterprises, the BOC Network helps to recirculate capital through neighborhood economies, and so to revitalize whole communities.

Individually and in concert, the BOC Network's growing alliance of Business Outreach Centers, or BOCs, connect local entrepreneurs to the full complement of business assistance services, as well as to financial, legal, and other resources. In the process, they successfully guide them through the process of starting and developing their enterprises, and then follow-up with them as they progress and their needs evolve.

Speaking the languages of the communities they serve, individual BOCs have proven to be ideally suited to reach and extend a guiding hand to local entrepreneurs whose challenges are many and resources few. BOC business counselors provide one-on-one needs assessment, business planning, marketing and management guidance, as well as access to resources through the BOC Network's extensive linkages with the full spectrum of public and private business assistance sources.

Moreover, the BOC Network serves as a highly interactive forum for sharing technology and resources across community and cultural lines, enabling local entrepreneurs to familiarize themselves with the latest business practices, to forge meaningful links with mainstream services, markets, and mentors, and to gain access to new business-development opportunities.

In other words, the BOC Network makes connections that make the system work for local entrepreneurs, communities, regions, service providers, and the economy as a whole.",N,N,N,Y,N,7182461881,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,,Y,N,N,Y,N,,Business Outreach Center Network,N,N,,N,7186249115,11217,N,Published,Y,Y,http://www.bocnet.org/boc/home.html,N,N,N

path to self-sufficiency by giving them the skills to succeed, supporting
and strengthening their families and, when necessary, supplementing their families.

The programs operated by Graham Windham are inspired by one single steadfast vision of a city where children are protected from pain and suffering and are free to mature in safe and loving homes. All of our pioneering initiatives over our 200 years of uninterrupted service to New York's neediest children and families grow out of a commitment to making this vision real for the thousands of citizens we serve each year.

We recognize that the children we serve today face an array of challenges and difficulties - often dire - that will jeopardize their ability to survive, grow and prosper if left unaddressed. First and foremost, they need safe and caring homes, followed by professional assistance to help them with their problems and real opportunities to learn and develop and to expand their horizons. Today's Graham Windham continues to experiment, innovate and expand its broad spectrum of multidisciplinary services to include whatever it takes to enable children and their families to triumph over conditions that put their chances for learning, growing and staying together at risk.

Nowhere is the barrier to success and wellbeing more apparent than in the area of education and literacy. Education is still the best ticket out of poverty and limited opportunity and the children we server all too often get the least our American educational system has to offer. Fully understanding the crushing nature of this disadvantage, Graham Windham has added educational supports and literacy enhancements to every one of its programs up and down the continuum of care. Ensuring that all our children have the tools and assistance needed to master their potential has become our signature goal.

Throughout its proud 200 year history, Graham Windham has been on the front lines of child welfare policy and practice. We take a back seat to no one when it comes to the health and welfare of the children and families we serve. This remains true today and will remain true tomorrow. We are committed to continued quality improvement - for our children and families, their home communities and for this distinguished and historic child welfare agency.",N,N,Y,N,N,2122535829,N,N,N,N,N,N,40.735203,N,N,"{'latitude': '40.735203', 'needs_recoding': False, 'longitude': '-73.987898'}",-73.987898,Y,N,N,Y,N,Gramercy                                                                   ,Graham Windham,N,Y,Hastings-on-Hudson,N,2125296445,10003,N,Published,N,Y,http://www.graham-windham.org,N,Y,Y

The Power of Culture is of everyone 

History 

The Dominican Foundation Culturarte of New York was founded in June 20th, 2001 under the guidance of Dr. Jorge Pi,a psychotherapist and poet and with visual artist and poet, Karina Rieke. The organization believes that participation and education in the arts helps create mature, emotionally and intellectually well-rounded individuals. 

The Center's School of the Arts offers weekly classes and seminars on music, dance, theater, painting, film, photography, poetry, creative writing, journalism and literature. Through participation in classes and performance groups, students learn discipline and healthy self-expression. Our students, adults and young people, use the skills and talents developed in arts training as an artistic alternative to the prevention of violence, drug abuse, low-educational attainment levels, poverty and other issues that plague our community. Culturarte's goal is to create a well-educated, healthy, and creative community. 

Located in the heart of Washington Heights, Culturarte serves members of the over 400,000-immigrant community from South and Central America and the Caribbean. Providing artistic educational services keeps participants in touch with their heritage, while acting as a bridge to the culture and environment of the United States and New York City. For first-and second-generation members of the community, the ills of the inner-city often supplant the values of their native culture.

Enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act originally was a retirement program intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who coould no longer perform gainful labor.  In more than half a century since its enactment, coverage has been added for other groups of workers.  Social  Security also administers a needs based program called Supplemental Security Income(SSI) for those who do not have sufficient coverage to entitle them to Social Security benefits and who meet certain income and resource limits. 
Nearly 60 percent of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women.  In the 21st century, more women work, pay Social security taxes and earn credit toward their own monthly retirement income than in any other time in our nation's history. Women tend to care for many people including spouses, children and parents.  Women are more likely to earn less over their lifetimes than men.  Women are less often covered by private retirement plans and more dependent on Social Security- and for a longer period of time since, on average, women live about five years longer than men. When women work, they pay taxes into the Social Security system, providing their own benefits. Women who do not work are often covered through their husbands' work and can receive benefits based on their current husband or prior husband's work record when they retire, become disabled or die. Women should remember to contact Social Security to correct the information Social Security has for them, if they change their name through divorce or marriage
For information on benefits, entitlement, and eligibility go to www.socialsecurity.gov/women. The web site has a specific section devoted to women's issues. At age 65, most women will be eligible for Medicare Par A if they are eligible for benefits on their own record or on their husband's record.  Women will have the opportunity to buy Medicare medical insurance (Part B) for a monthly premium.  If they are not eligible for a benefit because they do not have enough credits, they can purchase Medicare coverage by paying a monthly premium.  For more information, go to  www.Medicare.gov or call the toll-free Medicare information number at 1-800-633-4227. For more Social Security information visit our web site at www.socialsecurity.gov.

SingleStop bridges the information gap separating low-income families from life-changing public benefits, tax credits and other essential services that remain untapped and inaccessible. These basic resources - food, health insurance, child care and tax refunds - increase the likelihood that families are healthy and stable, with parents who work and children who attend school.

SingleStop USA is the ambitious nationwide expansion of SingleStop NY, a remarkably successful program launched by the Robin Hood Foundation to connect the working poor in New York with government funds and services intended for them.

Incorporated as a non-profit in March, 2007, SingleStop USA encompasses the existing New York program, as well new efforts throughout the country. In its first five years, SingleStop USA will deliver $2 billion in benefits to up to a million households.

These efforts change the way America combats poverty by focusing on prevention rather than intervention. Benefits provide a cushion against the small setbacks - a sick child, car trouble, temporary job loss - that can become catastrophes in the lives of the working poor.",N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,40.805258,N,N,"{'latitude': '40.805258', 'needs_recoding': False, 'longitude': '-73.938875'}",-73.938875,Y,N,N,Y,N,East Harlem North                                                          ,Single Stop USA,N,N,,Y,2124802870,10035,N,Published,N,N,http://www.singlestopusa.org,N,N,N

Lynn realized that New York City suffered from an image problem: almost everyone she spoke to wanted to visit New York City, but thought the city was too dangerous, expensive and overwhelming. Lynn wanted the world to know New York City as she did: a great big small town with diverse neighborhoods, mom-and-pop stores, fun places to dine, and friendly residents who go out of their way to help an out-of-towner feel welcome.
Today, there are about 300 volunteer Greeters who bring visitors to neighborhoods in New York City, and 30 volunteers who work in Big Apple Greeterâ€™s office in every aspect of the program, from answering visitorsâ€™ questions and matching visitors with Greeters, to computer tech support and special events. Since its start in 1992, Big Apple Greeter has welcomed more than 88,000 visitors from all 50 states and 124 countries, with visits conducted in 22 languages.

Among the many programs CEW offers are its Young Executive Cocktail Parties, Women in Beauty Series, Speed Networking Events and Newsmaker Forums. Major trade events include the Beauty Awards program and the Achiever Award event. The Holiday Luncheon and Auction is sponsored by the Foundation. 

CEW was founded in 1954 as a social organization for professional women working in the cosmetics industry. The organization remained relatively small and social in the 1960s and 1970s, with the annual Holiday Luncheon as its keystone. 

CEWâ€™s mission was expanded in 1975 to encompass â€œpromoting the contributions of women in the cosmetics industry,â€ primarily through the addition of another annual event: The Achiever Award Lunch. 

In 1985 the organization again expanded its mission to include education, philanthropy, and industry development. 

In 1993 CEW's philanthropic arm, the CEW Foundation, was established to help women better their lives.  In 2001, the Foundation developed the Cancer and Careers program, an online and offline resource to support working women with cancer and their employers, coworkers, caregivers and healthcare providers.
